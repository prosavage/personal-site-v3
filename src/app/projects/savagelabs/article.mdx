#### From Gamer to Developer

From dabbling in high school Java projects to establishing a thriving community, my voyage through the realm of software development with SavageLabs has been nothing short of transformational. This venture that took concept in 11th-grade of highschool, propelled me to not only sharpen my skills but also to craft immersive gaming experiences that resonated with thousands.

#### Inception: Harnessing the Power of Minecraft

My journey began with learning Java from a comprehensive book before swiftly transitioning to the utilization of the [Spigot API](https://www.spigotmc.org/) to develop minor modifications for Minecraft. The satisfaction derived from witnessing my codes spring to life inside a game, as opposed to mundane text outputs, was exhilarating.

The initial fascination rapidly escalated to the creation of full-fledged game modes within Minecraft itself. One such venture was the development of SavageFactions, a plugin facilitating a dynamic environment where players could form factions and compete for territory and influence. The project, hosted on [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/SavageLabs/SavageFactions), encouraged contributions from other enthusiasts, amassing 95 stars and fostering a collaborative learning experience.

Being open-source, it also paved the way for constructive scrutiny, enhancing my expertise in crafting user-centric features and fostering productive collaborations. With nearly 60,000 downloads on SpigotMC, the project stood as a testament to my growing prowess in software development.

#### Building a Community: Discord and Beyond

Parallel to the development ventures, I orchestrated a Discord community revolving around my Minecraft plugins, nurturing a vibrant hub of over 2,000 members sharing a mutual passion for my projects.

#### Webstore: A Foray into Entrepreneurship

Venturing further, I re-wrote all my software with major upgrades in feature set and performance. Next, I harnessed ReactJS and ExpressJS to construct a webstore, serving as a dedicated platform to commercialize my Minecraft plugins. The webstore, equipped with OAuth authentication, versatile payment gateways, and automated updates via my [TeamCity CI](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) server, not only amplified my understanding of web development but also generated substantial revenue.

### Conclusion: A Fulfilling Journey

After a fulfilling span of four years, the journey with SavageLabs reached a juncture where new learning horizons beckoned. Having honed my skills in Java and Kotlin, and successfully establishing a webstore, I discerned the time had come to draw the curtains on this chapter. Despite the shutdown, the knowledge acquired and the memories remain.
